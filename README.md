# Deeplearning-keras

This repository contains implementations of popular deep learning architectures, along with notes summarizing key insights from the original research papers.

## Benefits
Deeper neural networks are more difficult to train. resnet present a residual learning framework to ease the training
of networks that are substantially deeper than those used previously. *so resnet gives us a deeper neural network*
